# OCR-on-images-to-recognize-text
Using Python and its libraries for Optical Character Recognition on images to recognize text using Pytesseract and identifying faces associated with the recognized text using OpenCV.

The project is being coded in Python3. In this project, we will manipulate images using pillow a Python imaging library and then apply optical character recognition to the images we have, to recognize text which will be done using Pytesseract, and we will be using the OpenCV library to identify faces in images.
